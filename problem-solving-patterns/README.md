## Frequency Counter
#### Definition:
- It's a pattern that uses an object or a set to collect values and the frequency of those values:
	- Create the Frequency Counter object;
	- Loop over the set of values(array, string, etc) and count the values and its frequencies to put in the object;
	- Use the loop again to verify if F.C object match with a condition (like verify if two strings is an anagram)
#### For What's Used:

### Multiple Pointers
#### Definition:
- It's a pattern that uses two or more pointers (index or position), and that pointers are moved towards 
beginning, middle or end based on certain condition.
   - Create the pointers (usually are two: left and right, start and end, etc)
   - Loop over based on condition
   - Move your pointers, decreasing or increasing, based on condition
#### For What's Used:
- To solve problems that you need to search for a pair of values (in a ordered structure) or something
that meets a condition
#### Help With
- Avoid nested loops
